## About some applications are still detected SbieDll.dll

First of all, you should not use this plug-in for bypass anti-cheating, 

The behavior of this plug-in is very similar to some cheat, which may cause your account banned!

Secondly, this module cannot fight the detection of the kernel layer. Related confrontation needs to write in a driver, and doing so in the kernel will make Microsoft Patchguard unhappy.

Finally, please bring a sample in issue, and I will try to correct this problem.
